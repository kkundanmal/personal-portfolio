# Challenge 2:GDP components over time and among countries

At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised


```{r read_GDP_data}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

 The first thing you need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and you must make it into long, tidy format. Please express all figures in billions (divide values by `1e9`, or $10^9$), and you want to rename the indicators into something shorter.


```{r reshape_GDP_data}

tidy_GDP_data <- UN_GDP_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(4:51,names_to="year",values_to="gdp") %>% 
  mutate(gdp=gdp/1e9,
         IndicatorName=case_when(
           IndicatorName=="Imports of goods and services"~"Imports",
           IndicatorName=="Exports of goods and services"~"Exports",
           IndicatorName=="General government final consumption expenditure"~"Government expenditure",
           IndicatorName=="Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)"~"Household expenditure",
           IndicatorName=="Gross Domestic Product (GDP)" ~"GDP",
           TRUE ~ IndicatorName
         ))

glimpse(tidy_GDP_data)


# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")
```

First, can you produce this plot?

```{r gdp1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/projects/gdp1.png", error = FALSE)
```

```{r gdp_plot}

gdp_plot <- tidy_GDP_data %>%
  filter(Country %in% country_list,
         IndicatorName %in% c("Government expenditure",
                         "Exports","Imports",
                         "Government expenditure",
                         "Household expenditure",
                         "Gross capital formation")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year,y=gdp,color=IndicatorName)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks=seq(1970,2017,10)) +
  facet_wrap(~Country) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x="",y="Billion US$",title="GDP components over time",subtitle ="In constant 2010 USD")
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) 
  
gdp_plot
```

Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in your dataframe, I would like you to calculate it given its components discussed above.

```{r calc_gdp}
filtered_data <- tidy_GDP_data %>%
  filter(Country %in% country_list,
         IndicatorName %in% c("Government expenditure",
                         "Exports","Imports",
                         "Government expenditure",
                         "Household expenditure",
                         "Gross capital formation",
                         "GDP"))

  
wider_frame <- filtered_data %>% pivot_wider(names_from=IndicatorName,values_from=gdp)
wider_frame <- wider_frame %>%
  mutate(calc_gdp=`Household expenditure`+`Gross capital formation`+`Government expenditure`+(Exports-Imports))
wider_frame %>% select(Country,year,GDP,calc_gdp)
  
```

> What is the % difference between what you calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe?

```{r percent_difference}
# using the percent difference formula from https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/algebra/percent-difference-calculator.php
wider_frame <- wider_frame %>% 
  select(Country,year,GDP,calc_gdp) %>% 
  mutate(percent_diff=round(100*abs(calc_gdp - GDP)/((calc_gdp+GDP)/2),2))
wider_frame

# summarise the differences by country
wider_frame %>%
  group_by(Country) %>% 
  summarise(mean_percent_diff=mean(percent_diff))

#summarise the differences by year
wider_frame %>%
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(mean_percent_diff=round(mean(percent_diff),2))
```


```{r gdp2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/projects/gdp2.png", error = FALSE)
```



> What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries? 

Based on the above charts, we can observe some interesting patterns. 
Firstly, all three countries have Household Expenditure as their largest GDP component, which has been consistently >50% throughout the range of years. Secondly Net Exports is consistently the lowest GDP component for all three countries. Germany is the only country that seems to have a positive Net Export component after the year 2000.
We can also notice that India has experienced a large(>10%) decline in Household Consumption and an increase (>10%) in Business Investment from 1970 to 2017.


> If you want to, please change `country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")` to include your own country and compare it with any two other countries you like

```{r custom_countries}
cust_country_list <- c("Sri Lanka","Netherlands","United Kingdom")
gdp_plot_cust <- tidy_GDP_data %>%

                         "Exports","Imports",
                         "Government expenditure",
                         "Household expenditure",
