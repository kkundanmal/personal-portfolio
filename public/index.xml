      <description>Executive Summary Airbnb is a community where guests can book living accommodations from a list of hosts. However, when an individual user books for a stay, it is hard to predict the quality and the price of a rental since there are no formal controls presented in the Airbnb. The aim of this work is to analyse data about Airbnb listings in Copenhagen and fit a model to predict the total cost for two people staying 4 nights in an Airbnb.</description>
